        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cinnamon roll recipe makes classic, home-style cinnamon rolls. They’re fluffy, soft, and topped with vanilla glaze. <p>It’s taken me some time to develop quick cinnamon rolls that maintain all the flavor of traditional overnight cinnamon rolls.</p> <p>I have the winner for you right here and I baked two batches just to be sure.</p>
        <p>Do you love homemade cinnamon rolls, but are nervous to bake with yeast? Join the club. I was too! But this recipe changed everything for me.<p> They’re perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to bake with yeast.</p> <p>Unlike these homemade cinnamon rolls that require hours of rise time, plus a 2nd rise time after the rolls are shaped, this easy cinnamon rolls recipe only requires 1 rise.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Icing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2-3 tablespoons strong brewed coffee or milk</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine the milk, water, and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm to touch (about 110°F). Pour into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir until it forms a soft dough or use your mixer.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface using floured hands, knead the dough for 3 minutes. Place in a lightly greased bowl (I use non-stick spray), cover loosely, and let rest for about 10 minutes as you get the filling ingredients ready.</li>
            <li>Fill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough tightly to make a 14 inch log. Cut into 10-12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9-inch round cake pan or pie dish.</li>
            <li>Rise: Tightly cover the rolls with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 60-90 minutes. See blog post above for my trick to this step!</li>
            <li>Bake the rolls: After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 25-28 minutes until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely cover the rolls with aluminum foil and continue baking.</li>
            <li>Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and coffee/milk together. Drizzle or spread over warm rolls.</li>
            <li>Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store for up to 3 days at room temperature or up to 5 days in the refrigerator.</li>
